            <h3>Project 1: Scarab</h3>
            <p>The Scarab was a revitalization of an old broken drone that a team member had in his house. The old, store bought drone
                had a broken frame and could not fly. So, the team member stripped of the old frame and 3D printed a new one. But, for some
                unknown reason, the drone would not connect to its flight controller, meaning that even though it was given a new body,
                its mind will never again be in the right place to fly.

        <h3>Project 2: Turbo</h3>
        <p>Turbo is our fist real drone that we have made. We are actually not done yet, so I will add more when we finish, and hopefully, get it up in the air!</p>
