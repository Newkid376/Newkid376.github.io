        <h3>Project 1: Dawn</h3>
        <p>Dawn was our first rocket. Built by two of our team founders over the summer, Dawn was meant to be 
            an inition into the world of rocketry. Built from humble plywood and sitting at about 4 feet tall, Dawn was painted in the colors
            of its namesake. <br> We flew Dawn from a field in North Carolina, supervised by rocketry officials. Dawn was flown with an H motor
            and flew almost 2000 feet into the sky. Sadly, we never recovred Dawn, because as soon as we had launched, the wind picked up
            and as Dawn reached its apogee and released its parachute, it was blown far away and landed in a grove of trees (or a soybean feild).
            This was a crushing conculusion to our first rocket, and the only solace to this loss, was to know that at least the rocket went up.
