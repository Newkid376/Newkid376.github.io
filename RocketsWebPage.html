        <h3>Project 1: Dawn</h3>
        <p>Dawn was our first rocket. Built by two of our team founders over the summer, Dawn was meant to be 
            an inition into the world of rocketry. Built from humble plywood and sitting at about four feet tall, Dawn was painted in the colors
            of its namesake. <br> We flew Dawn from a field in North Carolina, supervised by rocketry officials. Dawn was flown with an H motor
            and flew almost 2000 feet into the sky. Sadly, we never recovred Dawn, because as soon as we had launched, the wind picked up
            and as Dawn reached its apogee and released its parachute, it was blown far away and landed in a grove of trees (or a soybean field).
            This was a crushing conclusion to our first rocket, and the only solace to this loss, was to know that at least the rocket went up.

            <h3>Project 2: Birthday Suit</h3>
        <p>
            Birthday Suit was the team's second rocket. It is designed to meet the The American Rocketry Competition flight times and hights, as well as being 
            able to carry an egg as its payload. Made out of a cardboard body tube and lasercut plywood fins, it is light but sturdy. It has
            a simple altimeter in it to allow the team to see just how high the rocket flew. Time ran out 
            before the first launch, and the team was unable to give it a paint job, which is why the rocket has its name. As with Dawn, we launched Birthday Suit from a 
            feild in North Carolina with a H motor. During the first launch, the bottom half of Birthday Suit went ballistic 
            and the top half came down much to slow for the TARC specifications. This test launch allowed the team to diagnose their errors
            and make the necessary parachute and ripchord changes.

        <h3>Project 3: Dauntless</h3>
    <p>
        The Dauntless class was the team's first experince with 3D printing rockets. Haveing heard about the idea from a summer camp
        itnerary, they decided to try it out. One less experinced team member decided to take on this 3D pritning task. The Dauntless
        rocket was a PLA rocket that was a foot and a half tall. It was red with a black accent paint job. Its body tube was the same size as the C motor needed to fly it.
        Ultimately, the team member did not have enough experince to make a functioning rocket that did not look like it 
        would kill anyone, so it just sits on a table as a momento to his effort.

    <h3>Project 4: Archer</h3>
<p>
    After the first fiasco of an attempt at 3D priting rocketry, the team member decided to try again. Because most of the rocketry materials
    were being used for the yearlong construction of Birthday Suit, the 3D printing member did not have any parachutes or ripchords. So,
    they decided to make a missile. The Archer missiles are six inches tall and do not have a detachable nose cone and are made of PLA. Because the missile
    uses old A motors that the team member had lying around, they had to design vents in the top to allow the ejection charge to flow out of the body tube.
    The Archer missiles launch from an also 3D printed sidways launcher called the Sagitarrius, which is a three rail lancher. The 
    Sagitarrius is designed to be able to be afixed onto the underside of a plane and fired from. The Archer missles have been tested 
    and do fly, but their small size means they move around a lot in the air and are not accurate. A bigger size of the Archer misssiles 
    have been made, desiged to fly with a C motor, but have not been tested. A new launching platform has also been developed, but also 
    not tested (for fear of explosion and flying sharp things).

    <h3>Project 4: Arora</h3>
<p>
    In wanting to try to 3D printed stand up rocket one more time, and having gained more experince in CAD, they built the Arora. The Arora
    is made out of PETG filament and is completely green, like the northern lights it is named after. The Arora is more like a traditional
    rocket in that it has a smaller motor mount and then a bigger body tube, unlike the Dauntless and Archer missiles. The Arora was modeled off of 
    an older Estes rocket that the team member had lying around. Both the model and the Arora are flown using a C motor. Currently, the Arora 
    is ready for launch, but procrastination and a lack of close by fields as well as a fear of sharp, unpredictable flying things has delayed the rocket launch.
