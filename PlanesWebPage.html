            <h3>Project 1: The Kestrel</h3>
            <p>The TP-1 Kestrel was our first foray into the world of planes. The Kestrel was modeled off a tutorial found on JoyPlanes.com. 
                It was built out of Adams's Redi foam boards, and shaped using cutting techniques that the team learned in order to bend the boards.
                The Kestrel had flaps, alerons, elevator, and rudder, making it a very versatile plane. Its wings sat on top of the fusalage
                in order to give it more stablility for our beginning flights. Sadly, the project was plauged with misfortune from the start.
                Trying to find the correct foam board to build took months due to our school's shipping. Actually building the plane itself
                took about a month due to the short amount of time that we are given to work on it in school. Eventually, the Kestrel was
                taken home to be finished by one of the team members. When test flown, the Kestrel's landing gear repeatedly broke, and eventually,
                so did its magnificant wings. While, it did not do such a great job of flying, it did do a great job of teaching us what to do,
                and more importantly, what not to do, when building an airplane. After all, the TP in its name does stand for Test Plane.

                <h3>Project 2: Learning to fly... and then some</h3>
                <p>
                    After building the Kestrel, the team realized one very important thing: they had no idea how to actually fly a plane.
                    So, going to the store, they bought a ready made HobbyZone model aircraft to fly. The buying member of the team has been able to fly the 
                    plane for a short amount of time (there are not really any large fields in Virginia Beach), and has also figured out that the plane
                    is easily fixable if it crashes (because it did). The team is currently trying to find a time to all meet and learn to fly (if the 
                    weather would ever cooperate). The "and then some" part of this project is because after learning to fly, the team will mod the plane 
                    to give it some extra features. One of these features is the Sagitarius launcher and the Archer missiles. Another feature is rocket
                    boosters to give the plane a kick. Finally, the team is going to add the Daemon engine, a turbofan like engine with ten fans, which 
                    are split into sections of five fans and spin contra-rotatively to each other to produce more thrust.
